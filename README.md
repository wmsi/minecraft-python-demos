# minecraft-python-demos
A collection of demo scripts using the Minecraft Python API (most notably on the Raspberry Pi)

**Note:** Many of these scripts were not created by WMSI; this is a collection of scripts found online.

To run these scripts, you will need either:
- [Minecraft on the Raspberry Pi](https://minecraft.net/en-us/edition/pi/)
- A [mod for normal Minecraft](https://github.com/brooksc/mcpipy/) (see [WMSI's docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1S5ELl6rjyZaFPtay1rS4_hfbhR_5EV06hGwtRfO31gE/edit#heading=h.dp8zbvcsc1k) for installation)

## code/
A place for the Minecraft Python API python files

## scripts/
A place for various shell scripts used on Raspberry Pis (and maybe Macs) running these demos to reset world files, the script folder, etc.

## flatWorld/
A basic Flat World map for use with the scripts
